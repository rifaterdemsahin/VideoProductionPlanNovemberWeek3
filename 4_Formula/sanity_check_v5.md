## Project: Anti-Hype AI Learning Video (Day 1) 
Status: PRODUCTION READY - TIME CODED Owner: @rifaterdemsahin Date: 2025-11-15 Location: UK Primary_Asset: [[Delivery Pilot]] Series: [[AI Learning Roadmap]] Runtime: 90 Seconds (Based on 60s VO Spine) Tags: [project/ai-learning-video, status/production-ready, content/youtube, topic/ai-education]

## ✅ PRODUCTION PLAN: Day 1 AI Learning Video (90 Seconds)

The total runtime is **90 seconds** (1:30), paced by the 60-second voiceover spine. The B-roll sections (Scenes 3-6) are extended to ensure maximum clarity on screen recordings.

## ✍️ VO Script (60-Second Spine)

_This is the script used for the A-Roll recording and acts as the audio pacing guide for the full 90-second video._

|**3**|0:08–0:15|"Everyone says ‘learn AI’—but where do you actually begin? You need a foundation you can understand and build on."|
|**4**|0:15–0:25|"This Build-Your-Own-Model template isn’t finished code—it’s your learning lab. Every line is commented to explain what it does and why."|
|**5**|0:25–0:35|"Fork it. Read the comments. Change one function. Break it. Fix it. That’s how you actually learn. It’s called [[Delivery Pilot]]—your AI training ground."|
|**6**|0:35–0:45|"Deploy it locally—your private practice environment. Make mistakes. That’s the point."|
|**7**|0:45–0:55|"This is Day 1 of understanding AI. Not the finish line. Customize it. Study it. Make it yours over the next week."|
|**8**|0:55–1:00|"GitHub link in description. It’s not magic—it’s a starting point. Your AI journey starts today. Let’s go."|

# version 5
Got it. The 60-second script is the **voiceover spine**, not the total video length.

This is a smart move. It means we have more room for the screen recordings to be clear, un-rushed, and actually _teach_. The A-roll (face-to-camera) will anchor the video, and the B-roll (screen recordings) will get the time they deserve.

Here is the fully updated, Obsidian-friendly production plan. The total runtime is now estimated at ~90 seconds, and I've updated the shot list and production notes to reflect this "VO-spine" approach.

## 🎯 Core Concept & Assets

- **Video Concept:** Learn AI fundamentals through hands-on practice using a starter template, `[[Delivery Pilot]]`, that teaches you the concepts while you build.
    
- **Target Audience:** Mid-career professionals in the UK who want to understand AI—not fake it with copy-paste scripts.
    
- **Value Proposition:** Understanding through doing. Start learning today, not someday.
    
- **Runtime:** **Est. 90-120 seconds.** (Based on a 60-second VO script + extended B-roll for clarity).
    

### Core Strengths (Locked In)

|**Element**|**Why It Works**|
|---|---|
|**VO Script**|No fluff. No "7-figure AI side hustle" lies. Pure empathy $\to$ value $\to$ action.|
|**Tone**|Warm guide, not guru. "We’re in this together" energy.|
|**Visuals**|Screen inserts + face-to-camera = trust + clarity. **(Now un-rushed)**|
|**Thumbnail**|Anti-clickbait done right—educational, warm, readable code comments visible.|
|**CTA Card**|Not just a link—a learning roadmap. Genius.|
|**Motivational Ending**|10/10. Vulnerable, real, anti-overnight-success. Will retain viewers.|

## ✍️ VO Script (60-Second Spine)

#video/script #final

This is the **voiceover track**. The A-roll (face-to-camera) will be recorded from this, and it will be the pacing guide for the entire video.

|**VO Cue**|**Script (VO)**|
|---|---|
|0:00–0:03|"Stuck in the AI boom and don’t know where to start?"|
|0:03–0:08|"In 60 seconds, I’ll give you a learning starter that teaches you real AI—not just copy-paste."|
|0:08–0:15|"Everyone says ‘learn AI’—but where do you actually begin? You need a foundation you can understand and build on."|
|0:15–0:25|"This _Build-Your-Own-Model_ template isn’t finished code—it’s your **learning lab**. Every line is commented to explain what it does and why."|
|0:25–0:35|"Fork it. Read the comments. Change one function. Break it. Fix it. That’s how you actually learn. It’s called `[[Delivery Pilot]]`—your AI training ground."|
|0:35–0:45|"Deploy it **locally**—your _private_ practice environment. Make mistakes. That’s the point."|
|0:45–0:55|"This is **Day 1** of understanding AI. Not the finish line. Customize it. Study it. Make it yours over the next week."|
|0:55–1:00|"GitHub link in description. It’s not magic—it’s a starting point. Your AI journey starts today. Let’s go."|

## 🎬 Shot List (Paced to 60-sec VO)

#video/shotlist #final

The **VO Cue** maps to the script. The **Est. Scene Time** is the target edit length for the scene, allowing B-roll to be longer than the VO block.

## 📅 Expanded Week 1 Challenges

#asset/community #project/ai-learning-video

This is the automated DM/follow-up for viewers who comment "START."

**[Automated DM Response]**

> "You're in! This is Day 1. I'm rooting for you.
> 
> Your `[[Delivery Pilot]]` template is ready. The goal this week isn't to build a masterpiece—it's to get your hands dirty and _learn_.
> 
> Here are your challenges. Try one, or try all four.
> 
> ---
> 
> ### 챌린지 1: The "Hello, World!" Tweak
> 
> - **Task:** Find the function that generates the _final output_ (e.g., `print_prediction`). Change the text it prints. Run the code.
>     
> - **Why:** This confirms your environment is working and teaches you the basic Input $\to$ Process $\to$ Output flow.
>     
> 
> ### 챌린지 2: The "Parameter" Experiment
> 
> - **Task:** Find the `learning_rate` variable (it's near the top!). Double its value. Run the model. What happens to the accuracy? Now, cut the original value in half. What happens?
>     
> - **Why:** You'll _immediately_ see how one key hyperparameter affects training. This is 100x better than just reading about it.
>     
> 
> ### 챌린지 3: The "Break-Fix" Loop
> 
> - **Task:** Go to the `load_data` function. Deliberately misspell the name of the file it's trying to load. Run it. Read the red error message. Now, fix it.
>     
> - **Why:** Learning to read errors is the #1 skill in coding. This teaches you not to fear the "red text."
>     
> 
> ### 챌린지 4: Teach It Back
> 
> - **Task:** Find the _one_ function or code block that confuses you the most. Read the comments for it. Now, add _your own_ comment above it, explaining it in your own words (e.g., `// This part basically sorts the data so the model doesn't get confused`).
>     
> - **Why:** The fastest way to learn is to teach. Explaining it solidifies it in your mind.
>     
>

> 
> That's it! Let me know which one you're starting with. Just start messy. Let's go."

## 🛠️ Final Production Checklist

#status/production-ready

### Production Notes (UK TIME - GMT)

This plan is now updated and ready. The new ~90-second runtime with a 60-second VO spine is much stronger and serves the "learning-first" goal perfectly.

Would you like me to create a new, separate note for the `[[Delivery Pilot]]` asset itself, detailing its features and code philosophy?
